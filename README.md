# OBJECTIVE:

This dataset contain 5 months 15 days information from 1st january to 15th june 2023 about medical insurance claim from variours insurance organization through ayushman bharat scheme in Jharkhand. In this project, we can gain several insights related to healthcare claims. Here are some potential insights we can extract:

Case Number: In the provided dataset, the "Case Number" refers to a unique identifier assigned to each individual healthcare claim case. It is a reference number or code that helps in identifying and tracking specific claims throughout the claims processing workflow. The Case Number serves as a unique identifier for a particular claim and is used to reference and retrieve information related to that claim.

Family id : It is a reference number that helps link multiple individuals who are part of the same family or have a common insurance policy. The Family ID enables the tracking and management of claims and other relevant information related to the insurance coverage of the associated family members.

Gender: It refers to the categorization of individuals based on their biological sex. It indicates the gender identity of the patients involved in the healthcare claims.

Patient's Home District : It indicates the geographic location or district of the patient's primary residence. This information helps in identifying the patient's locality or region for healthcare administrative and logistical purposes.

Claim Status: We can analyze the status of claims and understand the distribution of different claim statuses, such as approved, rejected, or pending. This insight can help identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement in the claims processing workflow.

Speciality : In the provided dataset, "Speciality" refers to the medical specialization or field of expertise related to the healthcare treatment or procedure associated with each claim. It indicates the specific area of medicine that the healthcare provider or medical practitioner specializes in, based on the type of treatment provided to the patient.

This information helps in identifying and tracking the healthcare provider involved in the patient's treatment for each specific claim case.

Admission Data : In the given dataset, "Admission Date" refers to the date when the patient was admitted to the hospital or healthcare facility for medical treatment or care related to the specific healthcare claim. It indicates the exact date on which the patient's hospitalization or medical treatment began for the claim in question.

It indicates the exact date on which the patient's hospitalization or medical treatment ended for the claim in question.

Approval and Rejection Patterns: We can identify patterns in pre-authorization approval and rejection rates. This information can help in understanding the criteria used for approval or rejection and identify any inconsistencies or areas for improvement in the decision-making process.

Claim Amount Analysis: Analyzing the claim amounts paid by insurance companies can provide insights into the average cost of different medical procedures or treatments. This information can be useful for cost analysis, budgeting, and negotiating contracts with healthcare providers.

Hospital and District Analysis: By examining the data related to hospitals and districts, We can gain insights into the distribution of claims across different healthcare facilities and geographic areas. This analysis can help identify patterns, resource utilization, and healthcare access disparities.

Processing Time: Analyzing the time taken for claim processing, from submission to payment, can provide insights into the efficiency of the claims processing system. This analysis can help identify any delays or areas where process improvements can be made to expedite claims processing.


These insights can support decision-making processes for healthcare administrators, insurance companies, policymakers, and other stakeholders involved in healthcare claims management.
